# LoL Esports Analytics Project

## 📌 Introduction

**League of Legends (LoL)** is a globally popular multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed by Riot Games, where two teams of five players compete to destroy the opposing team's base. Since its release in 2009, LoL has evolved into one of the most successful and competitive esports titles, with structured leagues across regions such as North America (LCS), Europe (LEC), Korea (LCK), and China (LPL). Major international tournaments like the Mid-Season Invitational (MSI) and World Championship draw millions of viewers worldwide.

As a long-time fan of LoL Esports since 2016, I've followed the competitive scene with great interest — particularly in team strategies, player development, and regional playstyles. While I’ve always appreciated the game from a viewer’s and fan’s perspective, I recently became interested in exploring its **data-driven side**.

This project combines my personal passion for LoL Esports with my interest in analytics. Using detailed match statistics from **Oracle’s Elixir**, a leading source of professional League data, the goal is to uncover the **key performance indicators** (KPIs) that contribute to match outcomes and build predictive insights that could be valuable to analysts, fans, or even coaching staff.
